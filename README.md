## About `OpenTGX`

![open-tgx-logo-txt.png](./open-tgx-logo-txt.png)

`OpenTGX` is an open-source game development solution.

The biggest difference compared to the other frameworks is that `OpenGTX` is not only a framework, it is based on a unified basic framework and has plenty of examples and cases to meet the project's requirements and solve problems.

- `Open` = open source
- `TGX` = Take Gamedev Tech to more fields!

`OpenTGX` is based on [Cocos Creator](https://www.cocos.com/creator) (one of the top game engines in the world) and can work with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)( the most popular JS server-side programming platform) and Golang.

It targets to be a solution that can solve the daily development requirements and issues.

The **Get Started** will come soon.

## Why Do You Need It?

After communicating with thousands of developers, I found many strong needs as below.

1. **Skill Improvement**: Learn more tricks and get more practical experience
2. **Well-organized Project Templates**: Speed up project development.
3. **High-Quality Framework**: Useful Solutions to solve plenty of basic requirements and problems.

So I wrote and open-source the `OpenTGX` project.

Most of the content is based on my 15y+ experience in game development. It's not perfect but can solve many problems to speed up your development progress and make your project management easier when working together with many team members.

More and more components will be added in the future, such as networking, 2d games components, 3d games components, etc.

From this, Mr Kylin(me) will work together with other developers based on `OpenTGX` to give you more projects, examples, and tutorials which we think can help you a lot.

I hope more and more developers join us to make `OpenTGX` better.
